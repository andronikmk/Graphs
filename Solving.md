Solving Graph Problems.

1. Describe the problems using graphs terminoly
   + What are the nodes
   + When are nodes connected?
   + What are your connected components.

2. Build your graph or write your getNeighbors()
   figure out how to get the node's edges

3. Choose your algorithm and apply it.


1. Translate into graph terminology
   + Node: words
   + Edge: When words are different by one letter and both in word list
  
2. getNeighbors

3. Choose our algorithm
